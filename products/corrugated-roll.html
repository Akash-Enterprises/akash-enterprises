                <h2>Product Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Corrugated Rolls are made from high-strength corrugated paper
                    and are widely used as a protective packaging material. They
                    provide excellent cushioning and surface protection for goods
                    during handling, storage, and transportation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These rolls are flexible, easy to cut, and well-suited for
                    Indian packaging operations where manual wrapping and
                    cost-effective protection are essential.
                </p>

                    for improved protection.

                        For long-distance or rough handling conditions, corrugated rolls
