                <h2>Product Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Anti Skid Floor Marking Tape is designed to provide excellent slip
                    resistance while clearly marking hazardous or designated areas.
                    The textured surface improves traction and helps prevent accidents
                    in high foot-traffic and industrial environments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These tapes are easy to apply on clean, dry surfaces and are suitable
                    for both indoor and outdoor use. They are commonly used in factories,
                    warehouses, stairways, ramps, and commercial spaces.
                </p>

                <!-- ================= PRODUCT FAQ ================= -->
                <h2>Product FAQs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Is anti skid floor marking tape suitable for oily or wet floors?</strong><br>
                        Yes. The abrasive surface provides enhanced grip and is commonly used
                        in areas where oil, water, or moisture increases slipping risk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How long does the tape last under heavy foot traffic?</strong><br>
                        Lifespan depends on traffic intensity and surface preparation.
                        In industrial environments, properly applied tape typically lasts
                        several months to over a year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Can this tape be used outdoors in Indian weather conditions?</strong><br>
                        Yes. The tape is suitable for outdoor use, but for areas exposed to
                        heavy rain or dust, surface preparation and firm pressure during
                        installation are critical.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Does the tape leave residue after removal?</strong><br>
                        When removed carefully, residue is minimal. Any remaining adhesive
                        can usually be cleaned with standard industrial cleaners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What width should be selected for staircases and ramps?</strong><br>
                        Wider tapes (50 mm or 75 mm) are recommended for stairs, ramps,
                        and high-risk zones to improve visibility and slip resistance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Is this tape compliant with workplace safety practices?</strong><br>
                        Anti skid floor marking tapes are widely used to support factory
                        safety standards and internal safety audits in industrial facilities.
