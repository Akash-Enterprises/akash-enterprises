                <h2>Selection Note</h2>
                <p>
                    For Indian commercial kitchens, thicker boards are recommended
                    for heavy chopping and long working hours. Using separate boards
                    for vegetables and non-vegetarian items helps maintain hygiene
                    standards and avoid cross-contamination.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Are these cutting boards safe for commercial food use?</strong><br>
                        Yes. The boards are made from food-grade materials suitable for use
                        in restaurants, hotels, and food processing units.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Which thickness is recommended for heavy chopping?</strong><br>
                        Thicker cutting boards are recommended for meat cutting and
                        high-volume commercial kitchens to ensure stability and durability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do plastic cutting boards absorb odors or stains?</strong><br>
                        Food-grade HDPE boards resist moisture, stains, and odors when
                        cleaned and sanitized regularly.
