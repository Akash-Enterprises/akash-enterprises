                        <strong>Are car and bike covers suitable for outdoor parking?</strong><br>
                        Yes. Waterproof and UV-resistant covers are designed for outdoor use
                        and protect vehicles from rain, sunlight, dust, and bird droppings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Should the vehicle be completely dry before covering?</strong><br>
                        Yes. The vehicle should be clean and dry before use to prevent
                        moisture trapping and possible paint damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What type of cover is recommended during Indian monsoon?</strong><br>
                        Fully waterproof covers are recommended during monsoon seasons,
                        especially for vehicles parked in open areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Can covers cause scratches on vehicle paint?</strong><br>
                        Properly fitted covers made from soft inner lining materials
                        minimize scratching when used on clean vehicles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are custom-fit covers available for specific models?</strong><br>
                        Yes. Vehicle-specific and customized size covers can be supplied
                        for better fit and improved protection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are these covers suitable for long-term storage?</strong><br>
                        Yes. Breathable covers are ideal for long-term storage to prevent
                        moisture buildup while keeping dust and dirt away.
