                    making them ideal for short-term and long-term surface protection
                    across residential, commercial, and industrial projects.

                <h2>Selection Note</h2>
                <p>
                    For Indian work sites, thicker sheets are recommended where
                    heavy foot traffic, ladders, or tools are involved. Proper
                    edge taping helps prevent sheet movement during active work.

                <h2>Product FAQs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Is floor protection sheet suitable for marble and wooden floors?</strong><br>
                        Yes. These sheets are widely used to protect marble, tiles, and wooden floors
                        from scratches, dust, and paint during interior work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Which thickness should be selected for construction sites?</strong><br>
                        Thicker sheets are recommended for Indian construction sites where
                        foot traffic, tools, and ladders are frequently used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Can floor protection sheets be reused?</strong><br>
                        Yes. If handled carefully and not torn, the sheets can be reused
                        across multiple jobs depending on site conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are these sheets waterproof?</strong><br>
                        Floor protection sheets resist water and paint spills, helping
                        prevent damage to finished flooring surfaces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How are the sheets fixed in place during work?</strong><br>
                        Sheets are commonly fixed using packing tape along edges to
                        prevent movement during active construction or painting work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are bulk quantities available for contractors?</strong><br>
                        Yes. Bulk supply is available for interior contractors,
                        builders, and large renovation projects.
